# changeConsoleShortcut

If like myself you use an AZERTY ISO 60% Keyboard (and maybe for other layouts idk), it is currently impossible to open the console with the default shortcut (~). It is also not possible to change the default shortcut in the game settings.
So I decided to make this simple mod to change the console key to F1. You can still use ~ to open the console.
